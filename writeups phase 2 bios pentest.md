MISCELLANEOUS:


Chal 1):

Used strings function (strings strings.exe).Then you get a base64 encoded line(because last character was an equal to sign).Then i got a github link of srikesh bro
We get a file named file.txt.It had octal values.Opened it and decoded it .Then i got a base64 encoded thing and I decoded it again and found that its a png file.Then i saved it 
and i got a png file.scanned it and i got the flag


Chal 2):

Used chmod +x and gave permission.then when i ran the file i found that it was asking to perform certain decoding tasks(10)then i wrote a code for that
.Then my stage 1 was completed.Now for second one ,it was caesar cipher asked with different keys.so wrote a code for that.Then stage 2 was done.Now finally 
you have to receive some decryption pattern linked with alphabets,And then you decrypt it and receive the final flag.


Chal 3):

They asked us to google the content inside the file data.txt.So when i googled i just found something like wingding translator.When i translated it,i got the
flag 


Chal 4):

We get a file named msg.txt.Last character is equal to sign.Also they mentioned that its a famous encoding.So its base64 as far as i tried.Then i decoded it for 35 times.I got
a code.Then i just commented out some lines and printed the "out".i got the flag


Chal 5):

We get a file named chall.txt and get some numbers.decoded the hexadecimals and got some alphabets.Then when I asked for doubt.They asked me to observe on keyboard.So the flag was 
like between those each alphabet sets(also had symbols,no)
